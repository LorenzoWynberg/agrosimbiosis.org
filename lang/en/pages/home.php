            <p>The idea starting taking shape in the innovation and sustainability fair hosted by <a href="https://www.earth.ac.cr/es/">Earth University</a>, Gu√°cimo, Costa Rica.</p>
            <p>The project was one of the winners of the fair financed by <a href="http://www.sustainabilitylabs.org/">Sustainable Laboratory</a>, an Israily Company, which focuses on sustainable agriculture. With these funds we planted the seed and Agro Symbiosis was born.</p>',

            <p>We started dreaming of the creation of an integrated agricultural system in harmony with nature, while being surrounded by city, this will boost the consumption of healthy food by the community and a habitat for native species harmed by industrialization.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">After winning the innovation and sustainability fair, Agro Symbiosis starts its path to realize the dream.
